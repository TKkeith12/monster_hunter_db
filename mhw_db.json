This wyvern has enhanced stamina, health, and attack power, making it more aggressive than its standard counterpart. Known for its cunning, speed, and strength, the Azure Rathalos can stay airborne longer due to its stronger wings, allowing it to execute powerful aerial combos with fire breath and poisonous claws. Its aggression peaks during mating season, when territorial disputes and competition for prime hunting grounds are at their fiercest.",

		"ecology":"Uragaan is a massive Brute Wyvern found in the Elder's Recess, known for its signature ability to roll its body into a wheel, increasing its speed and agility to crush hunters. It can perform short rolls or longer ones, even rolling in a figure-eight pattern for multiple attacks. Uragaan can emit sleep gas or, when enraged, flames—inflicting sleep or Fireblight, respectively, depending on the gas's color (ghost-blue for sleep, red-orange for fire). It attacks by slamming its large jaw into the ground and sweeping its tail, which can fling explosive rocks. When these rocks are present, Uragaan's heavy jaw smash will trigger them to explode, similar to Barrel Bombs.",
